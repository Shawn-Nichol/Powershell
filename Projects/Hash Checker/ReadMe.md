The `Compare-Hash` PowerShell script is a utility that calculates the hash of a file using a specified algorithm and compares it to a provided hash. It provides a color-coded result indicating whether the file's hash matches the provided one.

Compare is used to ensure that downloaded files haven't been tampered with.
